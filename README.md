# LinuxShell

A simple Linux shell I wrote after doing a similar project for my OS class.

It can handle an arbitrary number of pipes and simple commands. I have yet to add a command history and redirect support, but I plan to add those in the next update. 

This code reflects my current understanding of Linux shells, and how pipes and child processes work in C.
